# Landing Page Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on creating an interactive landing page. The goal is to transform a static landing page into an interactive one by adding dynamic functionality using JavaScript. You will be building a navigation menu that updates as you scroll through sections on the page. Additionally, you'll implement smooth scrolling, section highlighting, and responsive design across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The landing page is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes including desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
- **Dynamic Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu is built dynamically by iterating over sections on the page. It updates as the user scrolls, highlighting the active section.
- **Smooth Scroll**: Clicking on navigation items smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: As the user scrolls, the currently visible section is highlighted in the navigation menu.
- **Scroll to Top Button**: A button appears when the user scrolls down, allowing them to quickly scroll back to the top.
- **Collapsible Sections**: Certain sections on the page are collapsible for better user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the landing page.
- **CSS**: For styling the landing page and making it responsive across different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, such as building the navigation menu, smooth scrolling, and detecting the active section in the viewport.
